Your interactions with our Virtual Assistant may be recorded and shared with our service providers that provide technology and services used in our Virtual Assistant or are used for other business purposes.</p>

<p>All content on the Fidelity Websites is presented only as of the date and time published or indicated and may be superseded by subsequent market events or for other reasons. Users are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements (indicated by language such as "believe", "anticipate", "expect" or similar words) which were based on information available at the time they were made. Fidelity undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any dated, forward-looking, or other statements.</p>

<li>
<h2 id="Accuracy">Accuracy of Content</h2>
<p>ALTHOUGH FIDELITY TRIES TO INCLUDE ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE FIDELITY WEBSITES, THERE MAY BE INADVERTENT INACCURACIES AND ERRORS, AND NEITHER FIDELITY NOR ITS THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, AVAILABILITY OR TIMELINESS OF THE FIDELITY WEBSITES OR ANY INFORMATION, TEXT, GRAPHICS, LINKS, OR OTHER FIDELITY OR THIRD PARTY CONTENT ON THE FIDELITY WEBSITES.</p>
<p>FIDELITY MAY CHANGE THE FIDELITY WEBSITES AND ANY CONTENT THEREON AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE, BUT FIDELITY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY DEFECTS OR INACCURACIES WILL BE CORRECTED OR THAT THEY WILL BE CORRECTED IN A TIMELY MANNER.</p>

<li>
<h2 id="Means">Prohibited Uses and Termination of Access</h2>
<p>You may use the Fidelity Websites only as permitted by law.</p>
<p>You may use the Fidelity Websites only for personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p>You may not do any of the following: (a) use the Fidelity Websites in any manner that could damage or overburden any Fidelity server, or any network connected to any Fidelity server; (b) use the Fidelity Websites in any manner that would interfere with any other party's use of the Fidelity Websites; or (c) introduce or permit any person to introduce into the Fidelity Websites any code or malicious or hidden mechanisms that would impair the operation of the Fidelity Websites, or of Fidelity's computers, networks, or other devices or software.</p>
<p>You may not access the Fidelity Websites using devices, services, platforms, or software ("Third-Party Access Tools") designed to provide high-speed, automated, or repeated access to Fidelity Websites. This prohibition extends to Third-Party Access Tools used or intended to be used to facilitate trading in a Fidelity account or to automate or otherwise assist the process of obtaining, downloading, transferring, or transmitting any information to or from any Fidelity account, unless such Third-Party Access Tools are expressly approved in writing, authorized, or made available by Fidelity for Your use.</p>
<p>You may not use any feature or services made available by the Fidelity Websites to interact with any Fidelity computer, network or service other than for the purposes and in the manner for which the feature or service is made available to, and is intended to be used by, users of the Fidelity Websites.</p>
<p>Certain parts of the Fidelity Websites require credentials, such as a username and password, to access them ("Restricted Content"). You may not obtain or attempt to obtain access to Restricted Content, including but not limited to Fidelity customer accounts, through any means not intentionally made available by Fidelity for Your specific use.</p>
<p>Any commercial entity that accesses Restricted Content without express consent from Fidelity for any purpose, including to view, transact in or manage Fidelity customer accounts, is in violation of these Terms, even if instructed to do so by an authorized user or another party acting with authority on the authorized user's behalf. No content made available on the Fidelity Websites may be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without express written consent of Fidelity.</p>
<p>Accessing, using, or disclosing any data, content, or materials (including Third Party Content and Restricted Content) from the Fidelity Websites in any manner inconsistent with these Terms or any other obligations that are made to Fidelity by You will constitute immediate and irreparable harm to Fidelity and/or the Third Party Content Providers and, in such an event, remedies at law will not be adequate. Accordingly, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, and regardless of any arbitration clause or alternative dispute resolution clause that might otherwise be applicable to certain disputes between You and Fidelity, Fidelity and its Third Party Content Providers shall have the right to seek equitable and injunctive relief (including temporary or preliminary injunctive relief) from a court of law, without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting bond, to prevent any unauthorized, negligent, or inadvertent access, use or disclosure. You hereby waive any right You may otherwise have had to challenge, in any legal proceeding, any assertion by Fidelity that Your alleged use of or access to Fidelity Websites caused Fidelity irreparable harm.</p>
<p>Fidelity is not waiving or purporting to waive any rights that the Third Party Content Providers may have to pursue any and all claims against You or Your agents in connection with the unauthorized use or disclosure of Third Party Content.</p>
<p>Fidelity may terminate or suspend Your access to the Fidelity Websites for any violation of the provisions of these Terms or for any reason whatsoever at its sole discretion and without prior notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="Password">Password Security and Notification</h2>
<p>If You have a password for access to non-public areas of the Fidelity Websites, You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any username, password, and other security data, methods, and devices. Further, You are responsible for all activities that occur in connection with Your access credentials or password, including all instructions electronically transmitted to Fidelity via the Fidelity Websites and all use of any data, information or services obtained using Your access credentials or password and other security data. Fidelity shall not be under any duty to inquire as to the authority or propriety of any instructions given to Fidelity by You or by a person who has logged on using Your access credentials or password, shall be entitled to act upon any such instructions, and will not be liable for any loss, cost, expense, or other liability arising out of any such instructions. Accordingly, You should take steps to protect the confidentiality of Your access credentials or password. Nothing in these Terms alters or supersedes any rights or protections that might be provided to You under Regulation E.</p>
<p>Do not share Your access credentials or passwords for the Fidelity Websites, or any accounts held outside of Fidelity aggregated through the Fidelity Websites, with any other persons. Doing so voids Fidelity's Customer Protection Guarantee (available <a href="security/customer-protection-guarantee.html" id="Link_1733842042235" name="Link_1733842042235" >here</a> and <a href="https://nb.fidelity.com/public/nb/default/resourceslibrary_redesign/articles/fidelitycustomerprotectionguarantee" id="Link_1733842062884" name="Link_1733842062884" >here</a>) and may also void account protections at any other firm where the accounts reside. Learn more about granting authorized access to Your Fidelity retail brokerage accounts here.</p>
<p>As an authorized user of non-public areas of the Fidelity Websites, You accept full responsibility for the monitoring of Your account including frequently checking Your account information, reviewing Your transaction history online and promptly reviewing any correspondence, account statements and confirmations received from Fidelity. Notify Fidelity immediately if You become aware of any unauthorized activity, disclosure, loss, theft, or unauthorized use of Your password. You agree to cooperate with Fidelity in any investigation and agree to take corrective measures to protect Your account from further fraudulent activity.</p>

<li>
<h2 id="Liability">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p>NEITHER FIDELITY NOR ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDER WILL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR OTHERWISE. FIDELITY AND ITS THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR LOST PROFITS, TRADING LOSSES, BUSINESS-RELATED LOSSES, AND/OR ANY DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM USE OF OR LOSS OF USE OF THE FIDELITY WEBSITES AND MATERIALS ON THE FIDELITY WEBSITES (WHETHER PROVIDED BY FIDELITY OR THIRD PARTIES). THIS DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY APPLIES EVEN IF FIDELITY AND/OR ITS THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES.</p>
<p>FIDELITY WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR ANY LOSS RESULTING FROM A CAUSE OVER WHICH FIDELITY DOES NOT HAVE DIRECT CONTROL. THIS INCLUDES FAILURE OF ELECTRONIC OR MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT OR COMMUNICATIONS LINES (INCLUDING TELEPHONE, CABLE, AND INTERNET), UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, VIRUSES, THEFT, OPERATOR ERRORS, SEVERE OR EXTRAORDINARY WEATHER (INCLUDING FLOOD, EARTHQUAKE, OR OTHER ACT OF GOD), FIRE, WAR, INSURRECTION, TERRORIST ACT, RIOT, LABOR DISPUTE AND OTHER LABOR PROBLEMS, ACCIDENT, EMERGENCY OR ACTION OF GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE THAT DOES NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SOME OR ALL OF THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES OR REMEDIES IN THESE TERMS ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT OR ARBITRATION PANEL TO NOT APPLY TO YOU OR TO BE UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT THESE PROVISIONS WILL BE CONSTRUED TO APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF FIDELITY AND ALL THIRD PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FIDELITY WEBSITES, OR ANY FIDELITY OR THIRD PARTY CONTENT ON THE FIDELITY WEBSITES, EXCEED $100.</p>

<h2 id="Indemn">Indemnification</h2>
<p>As a condition of Your use of the Fidelity Websites, You agree to indemnify and hold Fidelity and its Third Party Content Providers harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liability, costs, and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) arising from Your misuse of the Fidelity Websites or any Fidelity or Third Party Content on the Fidelity Websites, or from Your violation of these Terms.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h2 id="Law">Governing law, Choice of Forum, and Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p>These Terms and their enforcement are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of law, and shall inure to the benefit of Fidelity's successors and assigns, whether by merger, consolidation, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Absent Fidelity's express written agreement to another forum, any and all disputes arising from or in any way related to these Terms shall be brought, heard, and determined in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts sitting in Suffolk County. By using the Fidelity Websites, You submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with any such claim, suit, action, or proceeding and agree not to, and waive any right to, assert in any such claim, suit, action, or proceeding that (a) You are not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such courts or any other court to which proceedings in such courts may be appealed, (b) such claim, suit, action, or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or (c) the venue of such claim, suit, action, or proceeding is improper.</p>
<p>ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE ARISING FROM THESE TERMS AND/OR YOUR USE OF THE FIDELITY WEBSITES WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
